### Problem Statement
The problem that I would like to tackle in this project is: 

* What are the features of a property that sellers should look out for in order to sell their houses at a higher price in Ames?

Conversely, this will also be useful for buyers who might be looking to resell their house.

We will be creating a linear predictive model using using Linear, Lasso, Ridge or ElasticNet regression to investigate and identify the features which have a strong positive or negative relationship with housing sale prices.

### Datasets

The dataset used for this project is based off the greater region of Ames, Iowa. It is collected from 2006 to 2010 by the Ames Assessor's Office.

### Summary of Analysis

The liner model most suitable for this project is the Ridge Model.

The following features were identified as having a relationship with sale price:

|Feature|Relationship|
|---|---|
|overall_qual|+|
|ground living area| + |
|exterior quality| + |
|Kitchen Quality| + |
|Total Basement sq ft|+|
|Garage Area| + |
|1st Floor sq ft| + |
|Basement Quality| + |
|Garage Finish|+|
|Fireplace Quality| + |
|Full Bath| + |
|Total Rooms Above Grade| + |
|Foundation Material|+|
|Overall Condition| + |
|Neighborhood| + |
|2nd Floor sq ft| + |
|Age Since Remod| - |
|Age Sold| - |
|Basement Unfished sq ft| - |

From observing the features that have been identified as crucial in predicting house prices, we can see that area, quality, the type of neighborhood, condition and age all have a relationship with house prices.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

* Neighborhood: For neighborhoods, there is only a strong positive relationship when the house is in a wealthier neighborhood such as Stone Brook or Northridge Heights. This may be due to buyers being able to flaunt one's status <sup> 2 </sup>. Hence, sellers who have houses in these areas can expect to price their houses higher.

* Quality: We see that we have to care about many aspects of quality, such as exterior quality, kitchen quality and also basement quality. The materials used for foundation also plays an important role in fetching higher prices. Sellers should hence ensure that their exterior is refurbished with the best materials. Appliances and equipment in the kitchen should also be of high quality.

* Condition: We observe that houses with better condition do fetch higher prices. Hence, sellers should ensure that the house is undamaged and any damage is repaired immediately.

* Age: Out of all the features, age since last remodelling/addition has the highest negative relationship. We see a drop of -$7,813 with each unit increase of age since remodelled. Hence, sellers have to ensure that they modify or remodel whenever possible. Moreover, buyers hoping to resell houses should also not buy houses that are too old as old houses generally fetch lower prices.

* Size: As expected, the size of the house will affect the house price. Having more rooms above ground level dramatically increases the cost of the house, especially in combination with a wealthy neighborhood. As an unfinished basement has a high negative relationship with price, sellers should ensure that their basement is completed before selling.
