# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 2: Predicting Housing Prices with Linear Regression

### Problem Statement
The problem that I would like to tackle in this project is: 

* What are the features of a property that sellers should look out for in order to sell their houses at a higher price in Ames?

Conversely, this will also be useful for buyers who might be looking to resell their house.

Based on this problem statement, I will create a linear predictive model using using Linear, Lasso, Ridge or ElasticNet regression to investigate and identify the features which have a strong positive or negative relationship with housing sale prices.

### Datasets

The dataset used for this project is based off the greater region of Ames, Iowa. It is collected from 2006 to 2010 by the Ames Assessor's Office. A comprehensive data dictionary describing the features is included in the link below:

**Make sure you cross-reference your data with your data sources to eliminate any data collection or data entry issues.**

#### Additional Data
You are welcome to add any other data sources you find online to support your analysis, but this is **not required**.

### Deliverables

All of your projects will comprise of a written technical report and a presentation. As we continue in the course, your technical report will grow in complexity, but for this initial project it will comprise:
- A Jupyter notebook that describes your data with visualizations & statistical analysis.
- A README markdown file the provides an introduction to and overview of your project.
- Your presentation slideshow rendered as a .pdf file.
**NOTE**: Your entire Github repository will be evaluated as your technical report. Make sure that your files and directories are named appropriately, that all necessary files are included, and that no unnecessary or incomplete files are included.

For your first presentation, you'll be presenting to a **non-technical** audience. You should prepare a slideshow with appropriately scaled visuals to complement a compelling narrative. **Presentation duration will be 10 minutes.**
